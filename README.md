## 🚀 How to Run the Project

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    If the project is hosted on GitHub or any version control service:
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_link_here>
    cd X-Shop
    ```
    If it's just a set of files, simply download the entire folder.

2.  **Open HTML Files:**
    The project does not require any backend server as it's built entirely on the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS). You can simply open any of the HTML files directly in your web browser:
    * Open `index.html` in your browser.
    * Or open `html/product.html`, `html/cart.html`, etc.

    **Tip:** For the best experience, especially if you plan to expand the project, it's recommended to use a "Live Server" extension in VS Code or any simple local server to avoid CORS issues when loading files (especially images or dummy data from JSON files).
